# SageRice

One day a traveling sage was challenged by the king. To motivate his opponent the king offered any reward that the sage could name. The sage modestly asked 
just for a few grains of rice in the following manner: the king was to give a single grain of rice on the first day and double it on every consequent one until 
the month was over.

The purpose of this program was to calculate how much grains of rice the king will have to give the sage each day and how many grains of rice the sage will have by the end 
of the month.

## What I've learned
* For loops
* How important the order of operations is inside a loop (fence and post kind of problem)
* Inclreasing variables
* And much more knowledge added on top of what I already know
